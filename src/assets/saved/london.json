Guarantors are subject to the same reference procedure and checks as any prospective tenant.

Engel &amp; Völkers cannot accept liability for any costs or inconvenience suffered by the applicants.<br><br>Furthermore, the agent or landlord may be required by law to carry out immigration checks on any occupiers at the property.

Where an occupier has a limited right to live in the UK the agent or landlord is required by law to carry out a follow up check prior to expiry of the occupier’s right to live in the UK. Where the occupier cannot produce evidence that they have the right to remain in the UK, the agent and landlord are required to make a report to the Home Office.<br><br>Tenancy Agreement Fee<br>On completion of satisfactory references the prospective tenant/s shall pay a tenancy agreement fee of £360.00 inclusive of VAT (£300.00 plus VAT) for setting up the necessary tenancy agreement and legal documentation relating to the tenancy. Should the prospective tenant decide to use our tenancy agreement service before the completion of the referencing process, the fee is non-refundable in the event the references prove unsatisfactory or the tenant withdraws the application.<br><br>Change of Occupancy<br>If at any point during the tenancy a change of occupancy is required, a charge of £360.00 inclusive of VAT (£300.00 plus VAT) will be applicable to change the named tenants on the tenancy agreement. Any prospective tenant/s will be required to supply professional references for approval by the landlord.
